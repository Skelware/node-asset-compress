;Yo listen up here's a story
;About a little guy that lives in a blue world
;And all day and all night and everything he sees
;Is just blue like him inside and outside
;Blue his house with a blue little window
;And a blue corvette
;And everything is blue for him and himself
;And everybody around
;'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen to
